## Straightedge: A self-improving smart contract blockchain with alternative genesis token distribution

[Straightedge](https://straighted.ge/) is a WASM-based smart contract platform built on [Parity Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate).
It is a 0-day fork of the [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) blockchain built by
[Commonwealth Labs](https://commonwealth.im/).  The Straightedge blockchain
is being built because we believe in the vision of Edgeware but believe in trying to
improve on the original token distribution.

For this reason, we are planning to launch Straightedge on the 15th of September,
concurrently with the launch of Edgeware, as a 0 day fork, with the same feature set,
but with an alternative initial distribution.

The primary changes we propose are:
1) Contract deployers cannot signal on behalf of contracts.
2) No ["generalized locking"](https://blog.edgewa.re/generalized-lock-policy-who-can-appeal-and-how/)
3) Signalled tokens are immediately available in the genesis distribution rather than 1 year later
